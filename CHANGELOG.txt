Things the app can do:

* create multiple user accounts
	- check to make sure email isn't already registered
	- alert user if email is already registered
* sign in an existing account
	- check to make sure sign in credentials match
	- alert user if sign in attempt failed
* "sign in" / "sign out" link in header changes accordingly
* "create new post" redirects user to sign in/sign up if not logged in
	- after sign in/sign up, user is redirected to "create new post" page
	- or if user signed in/up directly from header link, redirects back to home page!
* create a blog post and assign signed-in user as the author
* add tags to a post
* edit a blog post if post author == signed in user
	- user cannot edit someone else's post
* delete a post
* view all posts
* view individual post
* view all posts by tag
* search all posts (title and body) and return all matches (this is imperfect as it will return partial matches on the string)



Things the app cannot do:

* support multiple blogs
* allow view-all-posts by author
* paginate posts
* display multiple paragraphs
* look not-shitty
